### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm MJ and I'm a Technical Lead at Waters!

In my day job I write .Net micro-services and use AWS cloud technologies but in my spare time I also develop mobile applications using Xamain Forms.
I also have experience developing IoT solutions ad I'm currently playing with Wilderness Labs Meadow boards.
